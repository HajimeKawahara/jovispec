* JoviSpec -- Jupiter high-dispersion spectra collection as observed by Subaru/HDS


This repository provides high-dispersion spectra of Jupiter and a little analysis of them. It includes an algorithm for decomposing the spectra of Jupiter, the Sun, and the Earth (telluric). This algorithm was developed by me ( @HajimeKawahara ) and @kemasuda, but the code is an old one I wrote back in 2016. Moreover, it was written for Python 2.7. This time, with minimal changes (such as making it run on Python 3), I am publishing it for use in high-dispersion retrievals of reflected light.
